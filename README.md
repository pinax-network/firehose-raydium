### 1) Raydium AMM Program (Liquidity Pool V4)
**Program ID**: `675kPX9MHTjS2zt1qfr1NYHuzeLXfQM9H24wFSUt1Mp8`
- **GitHub Source**:
  [raydium-contracts/programs/amm](https://github.com/raydium-io/raydium-amm)
- This code handles Raydium‚Äôs liquidity pools and swap logic.
- Constant product AMM integrated with the [OpenBook](https://github.com/openbook-dex/program) CLOB
- The Raydium AMM is an on-chain smart contract based on the ‚Äúconstant product‚Äù in a permissionless and decentralized manner built on the Solana blockchain.And it also shares its liquidity according to the Fibonacci sequence in the form of limit orders on [OpenBook](https://github.com/openbook-dex/program), the primary central limit order book (CLOB) of Solana

### 2) Raydium CLMM Program (Uniswap V3, Raydium‚Äôs CLMM, Orca Whirlpools)
**Program ID**: `CAMMCzo5YL8w4VFF8KVHrK22GGUsp5VTaW7grrKgrWqK`
- **GitHub Source**:
  [raydium-io/raydium-clmm](https://github.com/raydium-io/raydium-clmm)
- This program is used for Raydium‚Äôs Concentrated Liquidity (CLMM) pools.
- CLMM (e.g., Uniswap V3, Raydium‚Äôs CLMM, Orca Whirlpools) lets LPs concentrate their liquidity in a desired price range, boosting capital efficiency but increasing complexity and requiring more active management.
- CLMM is a more advanced AMM model allowing concentrated liquidity ranges.

### 3) Raydium CPMM Program (Uniswap V2, Raydium V1 AMM)
**Program ID**: `CPMMoo8L3F4NbTegBCKVNunggL7H1ZpdTHKxQB5qKP1C`
- **GitHub Source**:
  [raydium-io/raydium-clmm](https://github.com/raydium-io/raydium-clmm)
- This program is used for Raydium‚Äôs Constant Product Market Maker (CPMM) pools.
- CPMM (e.g., Uniswap V2, Raydium V1 AMM) is straightforward, but less capital-efficient.
- CPMM is a basic AMM model using ùë•√óùë¶=ùëò.

### 4) Raydium Router Program
**Program ID**: `routeUGWgWzqBWFcrCfv8tritsqukccJPu3q5GPP3xS`
- Handles routing swaps internally between different Raydium pools and sometimes across other Solana AMMs.

## Notes & Tips

1. **Multiple Versions**
   Raydium has evolved over time, deploying updated or migrated programs. You may find older versions within the same repo or in older commits.

2. **On-Chain Verification**
   To confirm a particular Program ID matches a specific repo, you can use `solana program dump` or a Solana explorer (e.g., [Solscan](https://solscan.io), [Solana Explorer](https://explorer.solana.com)) to inspect the on-chain bytecode and compare it to compiled code from GitHub.

3. **Official Sources**
   - Main repo: [Raydium Contracts on GitHub](https://github.com/raydium-io/raydium-contracts)
   - Official docs: [docs.raydium.io](https://docs.raydium.io/)
